eventually to make the layout responsive, we should use max/min height and width css

places and users:
ACTIVE
INACTIVE

only display and pull from ACTIVE


add hidden class forlayout stuff

if somethings not working right and its a reserved tag, try doing it with a div

css tricks a guide to flexbox
the way it's lined out, it's all in rows. to get columns, it's turned 90 degrees. to space out columns is not ideal, can get around it by
making a column and putting rows in columns
by default, everything is flex-direction: row


          {/* //when something's at medium size, the width of the column will be 4, when it's small size it's 3. There's also xs */}

          //align self to override alignitems for specific item in flex
          //flex is all in proportion to other flex values
          //flex is shorthand for setting flex-grow and flex-shrink to 1
          //flex-basis takes pixels; in an ideal world, this item would be this size
          default: when there is extra room, don't do anything
          flex-grow: take up the extra room
          it's not about the size of the items; it's about the size of the extra space
          the default flex-shrink is 1; when there's not enough room, just evenly divide amongst yourselves
          flex: first you say the grow, then the shrink, then the basis

//currently, a user can only RSVP if they have already voted. we can change this later

when a user RSVPs:

if(rsvp){
    update user table that RSVP is true
    create new entry in guestlist where eventId matches and user is null
}else{
  if (user ID is in the guestList){
    update user table that RSVP is false
    delete entry in guestlist with their userId and eventId
  }
}
